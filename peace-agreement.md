Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) agree to cease any hostilities and will allow the other party to live in peace and prosperity.

Because of the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, noone can really represent the parties. The individuals and companies below agree to uphold this agreement and will try, to the best of their abilities, to have others do the same. Everyone in the community that supports this agreement can sign it.

This document and its signatories will be published on the blockchain of both parties.
